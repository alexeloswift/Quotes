# Welcome to Quotes
This app displays a slideshow of quotes to the user. The quotes that need to be displayed are available in a JSON array. 
Each element of the array contains the quote, its author, as well as the time that it needs to be displayed.

I built an app using a UI framework of my choice and I display these quotes. Each quote is displayed for the specified amount of time, 
and the screen is updated to show the next quote. At the end of the slideshow, the view loops back to the first slide.
